        "full_prompt": "'Scene' and 'summary/exposition' are two crucial elements of narrative storytelling, and balancing them appropriately is an important skill in fiction writing.\n\nA 'scene' is a moment in the story that is dramatized in real-time. Scenes are usually vivid and engaging, often featuring character interaction, dialogue, and action. They are the building blocks of the plot, and through them, the story unfolds.\n\n'Summary' or 'exposition', on the other hand, involves summarizing events or providing information. Instead of unfolding in real time, summaries compress time and tell the reader what happened. Exposition provides necessary background information, like character history, setting details, or prior events. \n\nA good writer knows when to use scenes to make the story come alive, show character development, or increase tension. They also know when to use summary or exposition to move the story forward, fill in background information, or bridge gaps between important scenes. \n\nThe right balance between scene and summary/exposition can vary depending on the story, but in general, it's essential for maintaining a good pace, keeping the reader engaged, and delivering necessary information. A story with too many scenes and not enough summary might feel overwhelming or slow, while a story with too much exposition and not enough scenes could feel dry and unengaging. \n\nGiven the story above, answer the following question.

        "question": "Does the manipulation of time in terms of compression or stretching feel appropriate and balanced?",
        "full_prompt": "'Compression/stretching of time' in fiction writing, also known as pacing, refers to the manipulation of time in storytelling for dramatic effect, pacing, or other narrative purposes. Essentially, it's about controlling the perceived speed and rhythm at which a story unfolds.\n\nCompression of time refers to when events that take a long time (hours, days, weeks, or even years) are summarized or condensed into a brief narrative span. For example, a writer might compress several years of a character's life into a few paragraphs to quickly convey important changes or developments.\n\nOn the other hand, stretching of time is when a brief moment or event is drawn out over pages or chapters. It's often used to create suspense, emphasize details, or delve deeper into a character's thoughts and feelings. For example, the few seconds it takes for a dropped glass to hit the floor might be stretched out with detailed descriptions of the action, reactions, and thoughts of characters involved.\n\nStory time refers to the time within the world of the story, while real world time refers to the time it takes for the reader to read the story. A skilled writer can manipulate the relationship between these two to affect the pacing of the narrative, either speeding it up (compression) or slowing it down (stretching). This technique plays a crucial role in shaping the reader's experience and engagement with the story.\n\nGiven the story above, list out the scenes in the story in which time compression or time stretching is used, and argue for each whether it is successfully implemented.  Then overall, give your reasoning about the question below and give an answer to it between 'Yes' or 'No' only\nnQ) Does the manipulation of time in terms of compression or stretching feel appropriate and balanced?"

        "question": "Does the story make sophisticated use of idiom or metaphor or literary allusion?",
        "full_prompt": "'Idiom' refers to phrases or expressions that have a figurative, or sometimes literal, meaning that is comprehensible to a particular group of people. These can be cultural, regional, or specific to a certain group or profession. Sophisticated use of idiom suggests that the writer is skillfully using these expressions to lend authenticity to character voices or to convey specific meanings in a concise way.\n\n'Metaphor' is a figure of speech that describes an object or action in a way that isn't literally true, but helps explain an idea or make a comparison. Sophisticated use of metaphor suggests the writer could create impactful, original comparisons that reveal deeper insights about themes, characters, or situations in the story.\n\n'Literary allusion' refers to a brief and indirect reference to a person, place, thing or idea of historical, cultural, literary or political significance. It does not describe in detail the person or thing to which it refers. A sophisticated use of literary allusion implies the writer can effectively incorporate these references to enhance the depth and resonance of the story. They can provide contextual richness, evoke a specific tone, or draw parallels between the narrative and the work alluded to. \n\nOverall, when a writer uses these techniques well, they add depth, interest, and nuanced meaning to their work. It allows for a richer reading experience, where the literal events are imbued with deeper symbolic or thematic significance. \n\nGiven the story above, please list out all the metaphors, idioms and literary allusions, and for each decide whether it is successful vs it feels forced or too easy.

        "full_prompt": "'Emotional flexibility' is asking whether the piece of writing effectively balances action and introspection, and if it portrays a broad and realistic spectrum of emotions.\n\n'Exteriority' refers to the observable actions, behaviors, or dialogue of a character, and the physical or visible aspects of the setting, plot, and conflicts.\n\n'Interiority', on the other hand, pertains to the inner life of a character \u2014 their thoughts, feelings, memories, and subjective experiences.\n\nA balance between these two aspects is crucial in creating well-rounded characters and compelling narratives.

A good story often has plot twists, character developments, or thematic revelations that surprise the reader, subverting their expectations in a thrilling way. It's about keeping readers engaged and curious, never fully knowing what's going to happen next.\n\n'Appropriate': Despite the surprises and twists, the turns in the story must also make sense within the established context of the story's universe, its characters, and its themes. This means that even though an event might be surprising, it should feel appropriate or fitting in hindsight. It shouldn't feel like the writer has broken the rules they've set up, or made a character behave inconsistently without reason, simply for the sake of shock value.\n\nSo when someone wonders if a writer can make turns that are 'both surprising and appropriate', they're asking if the writer can strike this balance between unexpectedness and coherence, keeping the reader on their toes while maintaining a believable, satisfying narrative. \n\nGiven the story above,  list each element in the story that is intended to be surprising.

This could involve a variety of different elements, including:\n\nNarrative Structure: This could include unconventional timelines (e.g. a non-linear story, a story told in reverse), multiple perspectives or narrators, or unusual narrative voices (e.g. a story told from the perspective of an inanimate object).\n\nFormat: This could be something as simple as using unconventional punctuation or capitalization, or as complex as telling a story through a series of letters, diary entries, newspaper clippings, or other documents. In recent years, some authors have even experimented with using social media posts or text messages as a form of narrative structure.\n\nGenre Hybridity: Combining elements from different genres or sub-genres in unexpected ways can also be seen as an innovative use of form/structure such as Horror-Mystery or Comic Fantasy.\n\nPlot Structure: Deviating from traditional plot structures such as three-act structure, or following them in unexpected ways. For example, telling a story without a clear resolution, or incorporating multiple climaxes or using revelation as a device where a surprising, and often shocking, development occurs that was previously kept hidden from the characters and/or the audience. It's typically designed to provide new context for interpreting what has previously occurred in the story. \n\nLanguage and Style: Innovative use of form can also come in the form of unique use of language, style, or even typography, such as concrete poetry or writing that visually represents its subject matter on the page.\n\nThe goal of this innovation is often to provide a fresh reader experience, challenge conventional reading expectations, or to create a deeper or more complex exploration of the story's themes.\n\nGiven the story and the devices mentioned above, list each device used with a short explanation of whether it is successful or not.

Exposition provides necessary background information, like character history, setting details, or prior events. \n",

However, note that even minor inaccuracies exclude the text from receiving a 'YES' rating. As an illustration. consider a question that asks. \\\"Does each sentence in the generated text use a second person?” If even one sentence does not use the second person, the answer should NOT be 'YES'.

For instance, if the question asks. \\\"Is the second sentence in the generated text a compound sentence?\\\" and the generated text only has one sentence. it offers no relevant information to answer the question.
